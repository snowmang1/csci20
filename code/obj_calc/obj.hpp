/*
stack calculator built using a monolithic object.

this means that the object will obfuscate the structure (stack) of evaulation.

this object represents something like a simple calculator taking numbers and evaulating

- problem: representing numbers and operations [solved]
    we need an encoding for the numbers and operations of our calculator, lets use a struc and operations of our calculator, lets use a struct.
    our structure houses numbers for eval and characters for operations
    the operations will represented by the following:
    - '+' addition
    - '*' subtraction
    - '^' multiplication
    - '5' division
    - 'e' evaluation

- problem: what are the basic operations of this calculator [SOLVED]
    binary operators on which two numbers will be given (a,b)
    - addition: a + b
    - subtraction: a - b
    - multiplication: a * b
    - division: fractionalized a b: a/b
    - evaluation: symbolizes number for evaluation, termination operation

- problem: what structure defines the equations integrity preserving order. [SOLVED]
    stack<dicho> st.
    - stack of type dicho b/c dicho assist in evaulation operation encoding.

- problem: we need to be able to load this stack (st) in proper order. [UNSOLVED]

- problem: we need a way to evaulate a full stack. [UNSOLVED]
