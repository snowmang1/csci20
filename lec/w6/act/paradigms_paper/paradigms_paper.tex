		You will write a paper on programming language paradigms.
		Any resource on the internet that you deem trust worthy is fine for use.
		You will need to cite your sources,
			meaning please tell me where you got the information you use in the paper.
		This paper will be more of an information gathering exercise than anything else.
		Please attempt to write at a beginning college level:
			structure your paper in a meaningful way;
			conduct research from sources that you find trustworthy;
			write critically, if something does not make sense to you then state that.

	\section{Prompt}
		What is a programming paradigm?
		In particular please write about different types of programming paradigms.
		What they are,
			how they are used,
			why they might be important, etc.
		The prompt is slightly vague to give you room to explore,
			note that this paper should be around one to two pages of information.
