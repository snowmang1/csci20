\section{}
	\indent make a new directory in your Github repo named \textit{activity\_4\_1}.
	In this directory make a new C\+\+ file named \textit{sets}
	This is where all of this labs work will be done.

	\lstinputlisting[language=C++, style=code]{begin.cpp}

\section{}
	\indent make sure this new file can be compiled using \verb|g++|.
	In the event you have forgotten how to use this command.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item you must be in the same directory as the file you wish to compile.
			Check your path.
		\item you must use the \verb|g++| command as follows \verb|g++ <file name>|
		\item if done correctly the file \verb|a.out| should appear.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{}
	\indent find std::array in the C\+\+ documentation.
	Once you have found it please pay attention to how to use it and create three different arrays.
	Use \verb|prinf| to print out the first element of these arrays.

\section{}
	\indent find std::vector in the C\+\+ documentation.
	Create three different vectors the same way you created three arrays and print out some element from them.

\section{}
	\indent commit all the work so it stays on Github.
